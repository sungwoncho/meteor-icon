## Why?

Meteor Icon builds better package ecosystem for Meteor by making it quicker
and easier to communicate package information.

It's a hassle to jump between GitHub and Atmosphere to research the package
before using it. Meteor Icon allows authors to aggregate package information
and present it with a swag.

It also helps package users to make prompt and wise decisions about which
package they need to use and how.

Inspired by [nodei.co](https://nodei.co/), Meteor Icon cleanly displays
information including the install command, latest version, last published date,
popularity measures.
